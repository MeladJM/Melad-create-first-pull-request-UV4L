I expect for this course to widen my knowledge regarding the area of web application. Particularly in designing and implememnting it. I hope this course will be a tool to broaden my capabilities in order to grow as a software developer. However, in order to do that I just hope that the faculty in charge will set a great environment for us to learn efficiently. Nonetheless, i just hope to learn while having fun with this course.
